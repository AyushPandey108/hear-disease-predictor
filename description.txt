Title: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Overview:
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical features. Using supervised learning techniques, the model is trained and evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The aim is to create a decision-support system that helps healthcare professionals in identifying potential cases of heart disease.


Objectives:

Apply machine learning techniques for binary classification of heart disease.

Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.

Train and compare multiple classification algorithms.

Evaluate models using robust statistical metrics such as ROC-AUC and F1-score.


Tools and Technologies:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Git & GitHub
